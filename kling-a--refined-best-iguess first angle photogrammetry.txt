A meticulously crafted 360-degree photogrammetry sequence, capturing every 60-degree angle, seamlessly integrates the provided artifact input image. Each step enhances and accurately renders the front view, ensuring consistency across all sides. The process progresses through the four side views, maintaining precise symmetry and straightening the object as required, especially when dealing with isometric projections. This rotation captures every angle from the front to the left, rear, and right views, while preserving the intricate design on all sides. The result is a flawlessly designed 3D object, adorned with realistic textures derived from the input image. Every side mirrors the same intricate design, ensuring the consistency of geometric features and surface details. The final model is cohesive, solid, and visually stunning, perfectly aligned with the original input, showcasing a harmonious blend of technology and artistry.
