To create an accurate photorealistic 3D model of the artifact using photogrammetry techniques, we must first ensure that the artifact is captured in high detail from multiple angles. This process begins by capturing the artifact in a way that highlights its intricate surface textures, materials, and design. Photogrammetry will allow us to generate a high-resolution 3D model that is reflective of these fine details, ensuring the texture mapping closely aligns with the artifact's actual appearance.

The 3D model should start with an orthogonal view, which offers a symmetrical representation of the artifact as seen from the front. The first render should provide a clear depiction of its geometric features and any visible markings, ensuring that all nuances are preserved. As we proceed, the artifact will be rotated in 60-degree increments, providing a full 360-degree view. Each render will showcase the artifact from various angles, including the left, right, rear, and top views, capturing all details with high fidelity.

The 3D model's textures will be derived directly from the input image, reflecting the real-world material properties, such as glossiness, matte finishes, and surface patterns. Reflections and lighting should be accurately reproduced to match the artifact’s original visual characteristics. The rotation should be fluid and smooth, allowing for an immersive and consistent experience of the object from all angles. At a 12K resolution, each render should showcase the smallest details, ensuring clarity and precision in every texture and geometric feature, preserving the artifact’s original form and integrity.
important note : use the input image and do an rotation to view it at plain sight orthogonally to view if possible try to show first angle if the object is in isometric change and show the rotation correctly  side views left right and four sides with intricate precision
